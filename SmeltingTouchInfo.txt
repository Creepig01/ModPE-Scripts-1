Smelting Touch does exactly what its name implies; tapping blocks will return the smelted version of them.  Touching sand or cobblestone will turn the block into glass or smooth stone, respectively.  Touching any ore will give you the product (iron/gold ingot, coal, diamond, etc.) and will revert the ore block into smooth stone.  Tapping netherrack gives you a nether brick, wood gives you charcoal, and red mushrooms and cacti will give you dye.
